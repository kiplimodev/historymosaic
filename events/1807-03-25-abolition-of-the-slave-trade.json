  "date": "1807-03-25",
  "summary": "On March 25, 1807, the British Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act, abolishing the transatlantic slave trade across the British Empire. The act was the result of decades of campaigning by abolitionists including William Wilberforce and formerly enslaved people like Olaudah Equiano. It was a landmark moment in the long struggle for human freedom, though slavery itself in British colonies was not abolished until 1833.",
