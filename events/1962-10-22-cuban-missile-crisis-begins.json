Kennedy informed the American public that the Soviet Union had placed nuclear missiles in Cuba, demanding their removal and imposing a naval blockade. The 13-day standoff brought the United States and Soviet Union to the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war. The crisis ended when the Soviets agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for U.S. pledges not to invade Cuba.",
